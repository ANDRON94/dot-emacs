* TODO Introduction
* TODO How To
* Installation
1. [required] Install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].
   + I use versions 24.4 and 25.3.
   + Most GNU/Linux distributions provide GNU Emacs in their repositories.
     And installation process can be easy as 'sudo apt-get install emacs' =)
2. [required] Get configuration.
   + Just clone or download this repository to your Emacs directory:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git clone https://github.com/andron94/emacs-setup <Emacs directory>
     #+END_SRC
3. [optional] Install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/global/][GNU Global]]. It is used for source code navigation.
   + I also recommend to install [[http://pygments.org/][pygments]] plugin.
     It supports more languages out of the box than GNU Global.
   + You can also create gtags database for external libraries.
     + Set path to gtags database. Add it to '~/.profile'(or whatever you use).
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       export GTAGSLIBPATH=<path to gtags database. For example, $HOME/.gtags/>
       #+END_SRC
     + Create/Update database.
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       # Create directory. You need it only once.
       mkdir ~/.gtags
       # Link any libraries you wish. You can add more in the future.
       ln -s /LIBRARY PATH1/ /NAME1/
       ln -s /LIBRARY PATH2/ /NAME2/
       ...
       # Create or update gtags database.
       gtags -c
       #+END_SRC
4. [required] Run Emacs :) [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] will download and setup
   all packages automatically.
