* Introduction
It's yet another custom Emacs configuration =)
I hope, it will be a helpful starting point for an Emacs beginner.
The [[file:layers.org][configuration file]] is written in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate way]]
which means that it's also a [[file:layers.org][documentation file]] =)

** Learn Emacs

* Installation
1. Install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].
   + I use version 27.1.
   + Most GNU/Linux distributions provide GNU Emacs in their repositories.
     And installation process can be easy as "sudo apt-get install emacs" =)
2. Get configuration.
   + Just clone or download this repository to your Emacs directory:
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git clone https://github.com/andron94/emacs-setup <Emacs directory>
     #+END_SRC
3. Run Emacs :) [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] will download and configure
   all packages automatically.
4. I also recommend using Emacs in daemon mode.
   More about it you can find on [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsAsDaemon][EmacsWiki]].
